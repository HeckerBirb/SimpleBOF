# SimpleBOF

Simple Buffer Overflow scripts ready to be edited for basic stack-based buffer overflows, e.g. Brainpan, SLmail or (parts of VulnServer).

SPOILER: THESE SCRIPTS ARE BASED ON ONE OF THE VULNSERVER ATTACKS. IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO TEST THE VULNSERVER VULNERABILITY WITH THESE SCRIPTS, BE SURE TO DELETE THE IMPORTANT PARTS AND FORGET THEIR ORIGINAL VALUES. THE VALUES ARE LEFT IN PLACE FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE EXAMPLE ATTACK.
